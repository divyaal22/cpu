Description
------------

    cpu package reports processor topology information

    Note that the term package refers to a physical processor
    and system refers to multiple packages. Also, a processor's
    hardware capability may differ from its configuration.

Usage
-----
    See main.go for output information and usage

Compiling
---------
    make          builds the package
    make install  builds and installs the package
    make example  builds, installs the package, and creates the example program

Testing
-------
    run the example program

TODO
----
- add error enumerations
- if 64-bit, or newer 32-bit, and the leaf value is less than 4 check IA32_MISC_ENABLES bit 22

Misc
----
- Package refers to a physical processor that plugs in to a socket
- Core refers to a physical sub-system of a package. A core may contain 1 or more
  logical processors
- A logical processor refers to a hardware resource that can execute a single thread
- Hyper-threading refers to the technology that allows a processor core to provide the
  functionality of more than one logical core
- Simultaneous Multi-Threading refers to multiple logical processors within the same core
- Multi-Core Processor contains more than one physical core
- MultiProcessor Platform contains multiple physical sockets
- Hardware Multithreading refers to any combination of hardware support to allow
  multithreading, which could be any combination of SMT, multi-core, and multi-processor
- Processor Topology is the hierarchical relationship of shared vs dedicated hardware resources
